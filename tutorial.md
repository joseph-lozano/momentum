# Seting up InertiaJS with Phoenix

## Initial Setup

First, we create a new Phoenix project. For simplicity, I created this repo with the `--no-ecto` flag to skip a database, since Inertia just deals with rendering. The project is called 'momentum' to be a bit cheeky.

The code for this repo is available at [https://github.com/joseph-lozano/inertia-phoenix-example](https://github.com/joseph-lozano/inertia-phoenix-example).

Each subheading corresponds to a commit in the repo, so you can easily see changes made during the project.
